# smt-data-challenge-2023
Project submission for the 2023 SMT Data Challenge. We chose to explore whether stolen base decisions could be efficiently simplified.

We used R (tidyverse) for our project, on Google Colab Jupyter Notebook. For more information, please look into the project paper.

We included the notes we took during our meetings over the summer under 'SMT Data Challenge Notes' because we believe it might give insight to our project process.
